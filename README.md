# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Project
 In order to create an
 effective brain tumor classification system, we investigated a wide range of deep learning,
 machine learning, and medical imaging approaches in this work. We addressed the prevalent
 issue of class imbalance frequently seen in medical datasets by applying Synthetic Minority
 Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) on a publically available MRI dataset from Kaggle, which
 contains tagged pictures of brain tumors. By ensuring that all tumor classifications were fairly
 represented in the modelsâ€™ training, this preprocessing step helped to lower the possibility of
 biased predictions.
 A thorough examination was carried out on multiple models, which included custom-built
 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), sophisticated transfer learning techniques, and
 conventional machine learning algorithms. In particular, we used CNNs, hybrid methods like
 CNN-SVM, and transfer learning using pre-trained models like Xception. We also tested with
 a range of ensemble techniques, such as gradient boosting, bagging classifiers, AdaBoost, and
 voting classifiers. We investigated Vision Transformers (ViT), a cutting-edge design renowned
 for its capacity to extract long-range relationships in picture data, in an effort to further improve
 the performance of deep learning models.
